
****** Setting your project ***************

These are example of visual studio 2010 project to help you build your own application that communicate with JACO.

Note that in every project/application, you need to include the External_DLL directory in your root directory. For example, in visual studio, it is in you bin/release or in your bin/debug directory.

Inside the External_DLL directory, you must have those files:

	- mpusbapi.dll
	- TDx.TDxInput.dll
	- Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.UnitTestFramework.dll
	- Microsoft.DirectX.DirectInput.dll


****** Programming notes ******************

- References that you must include in your project:

	- Kinova.DLL.Data.dll
	- Kinova.API.Jaco.dll
	- Kinova.DLL.CommData.dll
	- Kinova.API.SafeGate.dll
	- Kinova.API.TcpConnector.dll
	- Kinova.API.TestData.dll
	- Kinova.API.Tools.dll
	- Kinova.API.UsbManager.dll

- If you think you messed up something with the client configuration, the Control mapping charts or the zone configuration, you always have to possibility to reset JACO calling
  the RestoreFactorySettings() method in the ConfigurationManager.



Enjoy your JACO :)
